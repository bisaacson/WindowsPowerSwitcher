# WindowsPowerSwitcher
Batch script for quickly switching between power schemes.

# Configuration
By default the script switches between "Balanced" and "High performance," but you can set it to whatever you like.
Run "powercfg -l" to see what your power schemes are named.

# Usage
Just run the script. It will see if you're on one of the configured schemes and switch to the alternate.
